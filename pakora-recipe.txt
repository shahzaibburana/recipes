Take "Baesun" :-P
Put water into it
add mirch, namak, aalo
mix it up
take a small amout of the resultant
put it into the fry pan (Note: fry pan must have cooking oil in it and it should be on a stove)
fry it until it turns red/brown/whatever
take it out, not with your hand , with a spoon or something
ENJOY
